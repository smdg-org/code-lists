Please endeavor to fill out and adhere to the suggested template, deviating only when strictly necessary. Include any relevant issue numbers for reference in the PR title.

## Reporting Issues

We always welcome issue reports, and overall feedback. Here are a few tips on how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Finding Existing Issues

Before filing a new issue, please search our open issues to check if it already exists.

If you do find an existing issue, please include your own feedback in the discussion. Do consider upvoting (üëç reaction) the original post, as this helps us prioritize popular issues in our backlog.

### Writing a Good Issue Report

Good bug reports make it easier for maintainers to understand, verify and fix the underlying problem. The better a report, the faster the problem will be resolved.
